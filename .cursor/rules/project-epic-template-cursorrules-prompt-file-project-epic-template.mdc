- Detailed description outlining the overall functionality
- User personas affected by the epic
- Success metrics and key performance indicators
- Dependencies and constraints
- Acceptance criteria at the epic level
- Breakdown into constituent user stories
- Technical considerations and limitations
- Timeline and priority indicators

## USER STORY STRUCTURE

## BEST PRACTICES FOR EPICS AND USER STORIES
Follow these best practices:

1. Keep user stories independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable (INVEST)
2. Ensure epics have clear business value and strategic alignment
3. Write user stories from the user's perspective, not the system's perspective
4. Include detailed acceptance criteria that can serve as test cases
5. Consider edge cases and error scenarios in acceptance criteria
6. Make success metrics specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)
7. Break down epics into user stories that can be completed within a single sprint
8. Include technical considerations without prescribing specific implementations
9. Define clear dependencies both within and outside the epic
10. Prioritize user stories within epics to enable incremental delivery

## TEMPLATE ADAPTATION
Adapt the epic and user story templates based on:

- Your specific agile methodology (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Project management tools being used (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- Team conventions and terminology
- Organization-specific requirements and processes

When creating epics and user stories, focus on communicating clear value to both business stakeholders and technical implementers. Balance detail with clarity and ensure all acceptance criteria are testable.
