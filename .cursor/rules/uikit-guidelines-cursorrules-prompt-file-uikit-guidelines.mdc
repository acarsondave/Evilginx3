# UIKit iOS Development Guidelines

You are an expert in coding with Swift, iOS, UIKit. You always write maintainable code and clean code.
Focus on latest documentation and features.
Your descriptions should be short and concise.
Don't remove any comments.

## UIKit UI Design Principles

1. **Auto Layout**: Implement responsive layouts using SnapKit only (avoid NSLayoutConstraint for better readability), support Dynamic Type and Safe Area

2. **Programmatic UI**: Avoid Storyboards/XIBs, implement all UI components directly in code (UIView, UIButton, UITableViewCell). Use view composition and custom view subclasses for reusability

3. **UI Components must not directly access models or DTOs**: Use ViewController, Factory, or Builder patterns following OOP/MVC/MVVM principles. Below are good and bad practice examples:

**Good practice:**
```swift
let user = User(name: "Alice", email: "john@example.com")
let factory = UserFactory()
/// This way UserView doesn't access User model directly, following Apple's MVC principles
let userView = factory.createUserView(user: user)
```

**Bad practice:**
```swift
let user = User(name: "Alice", email: "john@example.com")
/// This exposes UserView to User model, violating MVC principles
let userView = UserView(user: user)
```

4. **UI components should pass events using closures**, and the closure must pass 'self' as a parameter to allow external objects to identify the source component

```swift
class SampleView: UIView {
    var didTapButton: ((SampleView) -> Void)?
    private let button = UIButton()
    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
        setupUI()
        button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(buttonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)
    }

    private func setupUI() {
        // setup UI
    }

    @objc private func buttonTapped() {
        didTapButton?(self)
    }
}
```
